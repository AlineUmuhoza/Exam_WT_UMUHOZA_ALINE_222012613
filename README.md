PROJECT NAME: VIRTUAL PRODUCT MANAGEMENT PLATFORM

PROJECT STRUCUTURE

A virtual Product Management Platform project typically involves a multi-tier architecture comprising several components that interact to provide a seamless experience for users. Here’s a detailed explanation of the project structure:
1. Frontend
The frontend is the user interface of the platform. It is responsible for presenting data to the user and capturing user inputs.
2. Backend
The backend handles the business logic, data processing, and interactions with the database.
Technologies: Node.js/Express, Django, Ruby on Rails, or other server-side frameworks.
Components:
API Endpoints: RESTful or GraphQL APIs to handle requests from the frontend.
3. Security
Security encompasses all measures taken to protect the application and its data from threats.Components:
Data Encryption: Encrypting sensitive data in transit (using SSL/TLS) and at rest.
Input Validation: Preventing SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.
Access Control: Ensuring users have the appropriate permissions for their roles.

PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY

The Virtual Product Management Platform is designed to facilitate the entire product management lifecycle, enabling teams to collaborate effectively, plan strategically, and execute efficiently. Below is an overview of its key functionalities:
1. User Authentication and Authorization
User Registration: New users can sign up by providing their details such as name, email, password, etc.
Login/Logout: Users can securely log in and out of the platform.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different roles (e.g., admin, product manager, team member) have specific permissions and access levels.
2. Dashboard
Overview: Provides a summary of active projects, upcoming deadlines, recent activities, and key metrics.
Customization: Users can customize their dashboards to display the information most relevant to them.
3. Product Roadmapping
Timeline View: Visual representation of the product roadmap, showing key milestones, deadlines, and dependencies.
Feature Planning: Allows users to plan, prioritize, and schedule features and enhancements.
